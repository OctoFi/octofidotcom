OctoFi is dedicated to achieving the best possible distribution of OCTO governance tokens among holders. With that commitment we are thrilled to announce [Aquafarm](/project/aquafarm), our interest (and airdrop) program providing an attractive incentive scheme for investors.

Both private and public sale participants will be able to assign tokens to our interest yielding smart contract, to earn additional OCTO for 3, 6, and 12 month runtimes. 

## Interest program overview

A total of 200,000 OCTO split equally between interest yielding contract and airdrop, has been allocated to the interest program. Private sale investors cannot assign their Octokens early, and are afforded the same interest program access as public participants — the interface will be made available at [earn.octo.fi](https://earn.octo.fi) only. 

An additional bonus yield is rewarded to supporters who take part in the first batch, scaled accordingly to their nominated runtime. Depending on the demand shown for the interest program, further bonus schemes may be opened, pending the relevant discussions required to revise the conditions. 

Upon completion of the bonding curve sale, the interest program launch can be expected soon after. Our blog will be used as the first instance for all official announcements, then immediately dispersed across our twitter, telegram, and mailing list in accordance with UTC timezone scheduling.

## Interest program details

We've chosen to keep the program simple with measures to prevent any means by which private investors would have an advantage. 

| Runtime    		    | Interest rate p.a.| Batch 001 bonus p.a.| Total accrual |
|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 3 months     			| 10% 			    | 2.5%                | 12.5% p.a.    |
| 6 months 	  	 	    | 15% 		  	    | 5%            	  | 20% p.a.   	  |
| 12 months    			| 22% 				| 10%              	  | 32% p.a.  	  |

As detailed in the above table, the yield for respective interest program runtimes are as follows:

* Three (3) months: 10% per annum
* Six (6) months: 15% per annum
* Twelve (12) months: 22% per annum

For investors participating in the first batch of the interest program, bonus yield as follows:

* Three (3) months: bonus 2.5% per annum
* Six (6) months: bonus 5% per annum
* Twelve (12) months: bonus 10% per annum

To better incentivize mid to long term runtimes, the 200,000 OCTO allocation is split equally between the standard interest program, and airdrops disbursed to addresses completing at least six (6) months of runtime.

* 100,000 for interest program yield payments
* 100,000 for interest program airdrop payments

Airdrops are specified as 100 OCTO to each address that successfully completes six (6) months runtime of the interest program — obviously limited to the first 1,000 holders to do so.

## Interest program future

Additional yield bearing integrations shall be made pending community decisions made. The [earn.octo.fi](https://earn.octo.fi) interface is intended to be used to provide maximum value to Octonauts. 

All official announcements will be made on our blog first and foremost. Following completion of the bonding curve, we will announce official commencement for the interest program. The program will run perpetually until the interest program allocation is exhausted. 

In the leadup to the launch of the interest program we will publish official tutorials and user guides on the blog for those interested in participating.
