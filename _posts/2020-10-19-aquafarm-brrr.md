Our blog is evolving to become the home of three things:

1. Research
2. Tutorials
3. Recap-topuses

When it comes to recaps like this one, we do a quick news roundup of what's happened recently, including new integrations, product updates, and community governance outcomes.

If you want to stay up to the minute with the latest, we've setup a few short links especially for you:

- [news.octo.fi](https://news.octo.fi): Our Telegram Channel is where we make announcements as they happen, and we also share most of them on Twitter.
- [log.octo.fi](https://log.octo.fi): The Changelog on our docs website provides a simple overview of all of our latest software updates.
- [tg.octo.fi](https://tg.octo.fi): Our Telegram Group is filled with an amazing and active community of octonauts.

### Tentacles

There's quite alot of interest in what we mean by 'Tentacles' and it can be summed up pretty nicely in a single meme.

But more on that later...

### Make America Eight Again \#MA8A

With the upcoming election we figured we may as well have a little bit of OC'POTUS fun.

Because eight is better than great. 

The tentacles are taking over the White House and our latest NFT giveway will be drawn October 22.

### Coinbase page

Now you can stay up to date with the octopus directly from coinbase.

Just one of many integrations made possible by our recent inclusion with Kleros.

### War on Rugs

<script async src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-widget.js?12" data-telegram-post="OctoFiNews/101" data-width="100%"></script>

OctoFi has been rug-pull proofed. 

We locked approximately $2.3 million with our friends at Team Finance following their audit:

1. 200,000 OCTO from Project Reserve [locked for 1 year](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8f68ec1d2a52e331236d3aa84a8e9fac1286863014ca314d89e14c5beb5a58f1), with [25,000 streamed back](https://app.sablier.finance/stream/867) in real-time to project over 6 months.
2. Approx $300,000 [OCTO-USDC](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9c8c2b731982bf50f3e3392c67feb836c7a1cc5a358da0c43680bcbebecde0ca) and [OCTO-ETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x55dff4582036ca59af465bbceeac6663a70ce5dea31f94ea4d335456d62632a7) Uniswap liquidity locked for 1 year.

### Niktopus Patentacles

After [Nik Patel](https://twitter.com/cointradernik) reached out to us recently on Twitter, we created an OIP to vote on whether the project reserve should fund one of his in-depth coin reports.

<script async src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-widget.js?12" data-telegram-post="OctoFiNews/102" data-width="100%"></script>

As per the [OIP-8 proposal](https://snapshot.page/#/octofi/proposal/QmQZepxr99SYbKypx1azdEQkYNegmTPa5gPL7hzNRUoD1V) our community voted unanimously to proceed and offer to pay 100% OCTO, which Nik gladly accepted. 

Looking forward to his 81,000+ followers learning about OctoFi.
