As our beloved community driven project continues to grow, it captures the attention of newcomers, some of whom happen to be scammers.

In order to keep our community safe, we think it's really important that we provide additional resources for existing Octonauts to refer to.

It's a matter of reducing the friction involved in onboarding new frentacles by equipping you with easy access to everything you need. 

With that in mind, it's our pleasure to announce the OctoFi Due Diligence Checklist. It can be used to assess any crypto opportunity, not only our own.
